# microsetta-private-api
A private microservice to support The Microsetta Initiative

## Installation
The private microservice depends on Postgres 9.5. For OSX users, we recommend installing [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/). For Linux users, please consult documentation for the Linux distribution in use. 

Create a new `conda` environment containing `flask` and other necessary packages:

`conda create -n microsetta-private-api flask psycopg2 natsort pycryptodome`

Once the conda environment is created, activate it:

`conda activate microsetta-private-api`

Ensure that the `conda-forge` channel has been added to the conda install and run:

`conda install -c conda-forge python-dateutil pycountry coveralls pytest-cov` 

Install connexion version 2.0 (which supports the OpenAPI Specification 3.0) as well as the Swagger UI:

`pip install connexion[swagger-ui]`

Install the JSON Web Tokens library with cryptography support:

`pip install pyjwt[crypto]`

Install Redis and Celery with Redis support for out-of-band compute:

```bash
conda install redis
pip install celery[redis]
```

Then install the microsetta-private-api in editable mode:

`pip install -e .`
 
## Test Usage

In the activated conda environment, initialize a test database:

`python microsetta_private_api/LEGACY/build_db.py`

Then we'll initiate a Celery worker (Example shown is with embedded Celery Beat scheduler):

`celery -A microsetta_private_api.celery_worker.celery worker -B --loglevel=info`

*** OR (Allowing for multiple workers)***

`celery -A microsetta_private_api.celery_worker.celery worker --loglevel=info` (Start 1 worker)
`celery -A microsetta_private_api.celery_worker.celery beat --loglevel=info` (Start the Celery Beat scheduler)

Next, start the microservice using flask's built-in server by running, e.g., 

`python ./microsetta_private_api/server.py`

which will start the server on http://localhost:8082 . Note that this usage is suitable for 
**development ONLY**--real use of the service would require a production-level server. 

The Swagger UI should also be available at http://localhost:8082/api/ui .
